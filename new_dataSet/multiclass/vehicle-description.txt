Dataset description:
The StatLog Vehicle Silhouettes dataset (OpenML data id 54) contains real-valued shape descriptors extracted from binary images of vehicle silhouettes. Each record represents one object and is summarized by 18 continuous features designed to capture aspects of compactness, circularity, elongation, aspect ratios, rectangularity, variance along principal axes, moments (skewness and kurtosis), and a hollows ratio. The objective is to predict the vehicle type among four categories (opel, saab, bus, van). The dataset has 846 instances and 19 columns in total (18 numeric predictors plus one categorical target). There are no missing values. Class frequencies are moderately imbalanced but of similar order across the four classes.

Task description:
Formulate a supervised multi-class classification task to predict the vehicle category from the 18 numeric shape descriptors. Because all inputs are continuous and on different scales, consider feature standardization. Evaluate with metrics suitable for multi-class and mild imbalance, such as macro-averaged F1, balanced accuracy, and per-class precision/recall, alongside overall accuracy. Cross-validation with stratification is recommended. Models that capture non-linear boundaries (e.g., tree ensembles, kernel SVMs) often perform well.
