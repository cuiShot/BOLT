Model Output (Recommended Optimal Weight Vector):
Model 1: Weight = 0.2923
Model 2: Weight = 0.2815
Model 3: Weight = 0.1012
Model 4: Weight = 0.0916
Model 5: Weight = 0.2334


Reasoning for Weight Assignment:
- Model 1 shows strong standalone performance (Acc 76.73%, AUC 61.95) and complementary behavior; assign a core weight.
- Model 2 shows strong standalone performance (Acc 77.14%, AUC 61.77) and complementary behavior; assign a core weight.
- Model 3 is moderate by metrics (Acc 76.41%, AUC 60.42); keep a small-to-moderate weight for diversity.
- Model 4 lags in metrics (Acc 73.32%, AUC 61.04); assign a minimal weight.
- Model 5 has solid metrics (Acc 76.73%, AUC 61.82); assign a substantial weight.
