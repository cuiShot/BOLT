Model Output (Recommended Optimal Weight Vector):
Model 1: Weight = 0.25  
Model 2: Weight = 0.26  
Model 3: Weight = 0.17  
Model 4: Weight = 0.20  
Model 5: Weight = 0.12  

Reasoning for Weight Assignment:
- Although Model 2 has a slightly lower Accuracy, it has the optimal AUC, so it is assigned the highest weight.  
- Model 1 has a high AUC and little prediction disagreement with other models; it is used as a stable core model and given the second-highest weight.  
- Model 4 has stable overall performance and is retained with a medium weight as a supplementary model.  
- Although Model 3 has a lower AUC, it has a high disagreement rate (strong complementarity) with Model 2 and Model 4, so it is retained with a certain weight.  
- Model 5 has the weakest performance but has a certain degree of complementarity (relatively high disagreement with all models), so it is assigned the lowest weight to participate in the ensemble.
