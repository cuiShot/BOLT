Jaccard-Fault matrix
The Jaccard-Fault matrix is as follows (unit: proportion in [0,1], rounded to four decimals):
[
 [1.0000, 0.9286, 0.9107, 0.8947, 0.8500],
 [0.9286, 1.0000, 0.8814, 0.8966, 0.8333],
 [0.9107, 0.8814, 1.0000, 0.9138, 0.7742],
 [0.8947, 0.8966, 0.9138, 1.0000, 0.8167],
 [0.8500, 0.8333, 0.7742, 0.8167, 1.0000]
]


Model Output (Recommended Optimal Weight Vector):
Model 1: Weight = 0.1600
Model 2: Weight = 0.1770
Model 3: Weight = 0.2000
Model 4: Weight = 0.1830
Model 5: Weight = 0.2800

Reasoning for Weight Assignment (classification task):

- Model 1: Highest Accuracy (79.14) and strong AUC (82.14). High Jaccard-Fault (~0.896) but superior standalone performance justifies weight.
- Model 2: Best AUC (82.32), moderate Accuracy (77.54). High Jaccard-Fault (~0.885) but AUC leadership warrants weight.
- Model 4: Solid AUC (81.28) and Accuracy (78.60), mid-high Jaccard-Fault (~0.880). Reliable contributor.
- Model 3: Lower performance but more complementary errors (avg JF ~0.870). Small-moderate weight for diversity.
- Model 5: Lowest individual performance but most complementary (avg JF ~0.819). Small weight to inject diversity while limiting downside.


Final model weight list: [0.1600, 0.1770, 0.2000, 0.1830, 0.2800]
