Jaccard-Fault matrix
The Jaccard-Fault matrix is as follows (unit: proportion in [0,1], rounded to four decimals):
[
 [1.0000, 0.3793, 0.3333, 0.4815, 0.3793],
 [0.3793, 1.0000, 0.4815, 0.6000, 0.6667],
 [0.3333, 0.4815, 1.0000, 0.4286, 0.4815],
 [0.4815, 0.6000, 0.4286, 1.0000, 0.5385],
 [0.3793, 0.6667, 0.4815, 0.5385, 1.0000]
]


Model Output (Recommended Optimal Weight Vector):
Model 1: Weight = 0.44
Model 2: Weight = 0.06
Model 3: Weight = 0.12
Model 4: Weight = 0.32
Model 5: Weight = 0.06

Reasoning for Weight Assignment:

- Model 1: Best RMSE (3.5885) and relatively low high-error overlap with Model 3 (0.3333) and with Models 2/5 (~0.3793). Assign the largest weight as the accuracy anchor.
- Model 4: Second-best RMSE (3.6421) and strong RMSLE (0.1525). Although its overlap with others is moderate-to-high (e.g., with 2 = 0.6000, with 5 = 0.5385), its raw accuracy warrants a substantial weight; we keep 2/5 small to mitigate redundancy with 4.
- Model 3: Weak RMSE but most complementary to Model 1 ([1,3] = 0.3333) and moderate vs 4 ([3,4] = 0.4286). Retain a moderate-small weight to harvest complementary rescue on 1/4â€™s hard cases.
- Model 2 and Model 5: Both weaker by RMSE and show strong mutual overlap ([2,5] = 0.6667) and sizeable overlap with 4 ([2,4] = 0.6000, [4,5] = 0.5385). Assign minimal weights mainly for marginal diversity against Model 1.

Final model weight list: [0.44, 0.06, 0.12, 0.32, 0.06]
