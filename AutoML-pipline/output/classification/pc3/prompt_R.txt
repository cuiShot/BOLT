You must output the following three parts:
(1) Output the weight for each model. A model's weight may be 0, and the sum of all weights must be 1.00.
(2) Briefly explain the reason for each model's weight.
(3) On the last line, output a weight list alone, in the format: Final model weight list: [0.13, 0.22, 0.00, 0.33, 0.32]
The last line will be parsed automatically by the program, so strictly follow this format.


Model list:
Model 1:
- Validation set performance: Accuracy=89.32, AUC=82.05,
Model 2:
- Validation set performance: Accuracy=91.03, AUC=82.24,
Model 3:
- Validation set performance: Accuracy=90.29, AUC=83.43,
Model 4:
- Validation set performance: Accuracy=90.82, AUC=82.83,
Model 5:
- Validation set performance: Accuracy=90.82, AUC=83.92,

The Rescue-Confidence matrix is shown below. Each element [i][j] indicates the ability of model i to rescue model j when it makes a mistake; a larger value means model i is more effective at correcting model j's errors.
The model order in the matrix follows the list above (Model 1, Model 2, ...), and the matrix is 1-indexed to match the model numbering.
The Rescue-Confidence matrix is as follows (unit: proportion, rounded to two decimal places):
[
 [0.0000, 0.1281, 0.0804, 0.0726, 0.1037],
 [0.1674, 0.0000, 0.0363, 0.0340, 0.0658],
 [0.3290, 0.1241, 0.0000, 0.1425, 0.0903],
 [0.1437, 0.0000, 0.0186, 0.0000, 0.0173],
 [0.1062, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000]
]

Model Output (Recommended Optimal Weight Vector):
Model 1: Weight = 0.2923
Model 2: Weight = 0.2815
Model 3: Weight = 0.1012
Model 4: Weight = 0.0916
Model 5: Weight = 0.2334


Reasoning for Weight Assignment:
- Model 1 shows strong standalone performance (Acc 76.73%, AUC 61.95) and complementary behavior; assign a core weight.
- Model 2 shows strong standalone performance (Acc 77.14%, AUC 61.77) and complementary behavior; assign a core weight.
- Model 3 is moderate by metrics (Acc 76.41%, AUC 60.42); keep a small-to-moderate weight for diversity.
- Model 4 lags in metrics (Acc 73.32%, AUC 61.04); assign a minimal weight.
- Model 5 has solid metrics (Acc 76.73%, AUC 61.82); assign a substantial weight.



Final Model Weight List: [0.2923, 0.2815, 0.1012, 0.0916, 0.2334]
}



IMPORTANT: The last line of your output must exactly match the format of the last line in the single-shot example!
IMPORTANT:If the model weight is 0, you must also output it, and you must ensure that the dimension of the obtained weight vector is consistent with the number of models!
